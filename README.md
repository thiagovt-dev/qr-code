# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

For my solution I used the simple css and in css i used position and transform for centralize the qr code in the viewport. I also used root for create variables for the different color that were suggested in the template of the challenge.
